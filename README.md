#Dialects Translation

Although Telangana dialect is widely used in day-to-day conversations which is in verbal form, the literature used in books, newspapers, academic journals etc use formal Telugu language.

A few native writers of Telangana state have strived to keep the dialect alive by using telangana slang in words, poems, essays of their works. As a result of this a limited range of literature , written work of Telangana which are in documental form are produced.
In Spite of the efforts made, the scope of Telangana language is still narrow and is limited only to verbal form in majority and documental form in minority.
Inorder to mitigate this gap and facilitate digital abundance of telangana dialect we are creating a dataset of telangana words, similar to European Parliament Copus, which are collected from various manuscripts, books, essays, scripts, day-to-day conversations of native speakers.

How is it Unique from Google Translate?

Upon application of Natural Language Processing techniques on the procures data, we can build a equivalent telugu sentence which in turn can be converted to any target languages such as English.Whereas Google translate can translate only telugu, but unaware of Telangana vocabulary hence a direct translation from Telangana to English using it is not feasible.
This is where our application shines, as it acts as a bridge for translating Telangana text to Telugu text, the latter one can be converted to any language using Google Translate.
